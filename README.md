# SimpleBio
SimpleBio is a simplified biogenic voc emission model for CMAQ modelers.

Currently there are so many biogenic voc emission models including BEIS2, BEIS3, Megan and Globeis, so why should I develop a bvoc model?
While the ozone problem becomes more and more serious in China, and BVOC contributes greatly to the modeling of ozone, but most of the models need formatted landuse data, which I don't have.
So someday I noticed that wrf-chem has a simplified bvoc in-line model and wondered if I can use the code and make a cmaq one, then I started.
